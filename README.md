# Pac-Man 👾 🕹️

## Description

This is a basic Pac-Man clone where you control Pac-Man using the arrow keys. The same arrow keys are used to navigate through menus, and pressing Enter activates buttons. No mouse is required. Your goal is to eat all the dots and avoid the ghosts to complete the level within 5 minutes. The game also features sound effects to enhance the experience.
